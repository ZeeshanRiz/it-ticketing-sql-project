-- IT Help Desk Ticketing Database (SQL Project) --

Overview:
This project is a model of a IT help desk ticketing system using a relational SQL database(found on Kaggle.com). 
Based on a mock ticket dataset which focuses on ticket priority, severity, seniority of the requester, and what systems being affected. 

My goal is practicing the following:
- SQL Schema Design
- Data cleaning and cleansing (turning raw data into usable columns)
- As well as writing data analytical queries for IT operations

Technology Stack:
- SQLite (local file database: 'it_tickets.db)
- SQL (DDL & DML)
- VS Code with the SQLite extension

What I have learned:
Designed an SQL Schema from a flat CSV IT help desk dataset
Cleaned and transformed it into usable analytics
Wrote Queries:
	- to summarize ticket volume
	- understand and summarize tickets per severity
	- Find tickets that have tight deadlines or Potential SLA risks

If the database does not load or you would like to manually recreate it,
run the following in order:

1. schema.sql
2. sample_data_insert.sql
